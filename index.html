    Welcome
</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to the first draft of the internal change logging system. This is designed to be a quick and easy ticketing system that you can fill in when working on internal projects where ticketing falls through the gaps. This should allow you to create a page where you can update basic change details and allow and colleague that need to view these changes to access and view them. You will be able to log the changenumber, a description of the change, who made the change, whether it has passed QA, and the version number of the release product that it is going into. Along with any other information that you deem worthy of being included.

    Remember this is designed to be a light weight product so you do not want to be clogging you change logs with useless information, keep it simple, short and to the point. You want to include key information that a user or developer will need to know as and when they are looking for a peice of functionality or bug fix that went into the product. Everything here can be produced at little to no cost with the main expenditure being the time it takes to set up. Although if you are using this as a template rather than starting from scratch then that will cut down the time as well.
